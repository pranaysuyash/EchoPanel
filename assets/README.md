# Assets

This directory contains visual assets for the app.

## DMG Background

For the DMG installer to look professional, create:
- `dmg_background.png` (800x500 pixels, 72 DPI)
- Should include the EchoPanel logo
- Instructions: "Drag EchoPanel to Applications folder"
- Arrow pointing to Applications folder alias

To create:
1. Use Figma, Sketch, or Photoshop
2. Export as PNG with transparency
3. Place in this directory

If not present, the DMG will be created with a simple white background.
