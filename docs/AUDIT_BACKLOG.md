# Audit Backlog (EchoPanel)

Append-only queue for future audits and out-of-scope findings.

## Conventions
- Append new sections; do not rewrite history.
- Prefer one-file audits using `prompts/audit/file-audit-v1.0.md`.
- If a backlog item is converted into a ticket, add a note but do not delete the backlog entry.
