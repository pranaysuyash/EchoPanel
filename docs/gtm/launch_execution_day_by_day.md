### 3.3 Launch Day FAQ Preparation

**Common Questions to Prepare For:**

**Q1: "Is this really local-only? How do you prove it?"**
```
A: Yes, truly local-only. You can verify by:

1. Open Activity Monitor during a session
2. Monitor network activity
3. You'll see ZERO network calls to EchoPanel domains
4. All processing happens via MLX (Metal-accelerated) on your machine

Source code available for audit. No cloud backend required for transcription.
```

**Q2: "How does accuracy compare to Whisper/Otter?"**
```
A: In our testing, MLX Qwen3-ASR achieves:
- 90%+ accuracy on clear audio
- Comparable to Whisper base
- Better performance on Apple Silicon (Metal acceleration)

We support multiple models (MLX, Whisper) so you can choose what works best for your use case.
```

**Q3: "Why isn't this open source?"**
```
A: Valid question. As a solo developer building sustainable business, I'm keeping source closed for now to fund development.

However:
- All architecture is documented
- I'm very transparent about how it works
- Long-term, I may open source components
```

**Q4: "Will this stay free or become paid?"**
```
A: EchoPanel has a free tier (5 meetings/month) for those who want to try it.

Pro tier ($12/month or $79 lifetime) offers:
- Unlimited sessions
- All ASR models
- All export formats
- Priority support

Free tier remains free forever for light users.
```

**Q5: "What happens if you shut down the service?"**
```
A: Your data remains on your device. Because EchoPanel runs locally:

- You retain all your transcripts
- You can export all data anytime
- No cloud dependency means your data is not at risk

Lifetime purchases (if App Store allows) would continue working as long as you have the app installed.
```
