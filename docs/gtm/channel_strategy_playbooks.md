## 2. Hacker News "Show HN" Strategy

### 2.1 Optimal Timing

**When to Post:**
- **Best Time:** 2-3 days after Product Hunt launch
- **Rationale:** Cross-pollination, different audiences
- **Time of Day:** 8:00 AM PT (optimal for HN visibility)
- **Day of Week:** Tuesday-Thursday (avoid Monday/Friday)

**Avoid:**
- Posting same day as Product Hunt (dilutes focus)
- Posting weekends (lower HN activity)
- Posting during major tech news (distracts from your post)

### 2.2 "Show HN" Post Draft

**Title (80 chars max):**
```
Show HN: I built a local-only meeting transcription app for Mac because I was tired of cloud bots
```

**Post Body:**
```
After using Otter.ai, Fireflies.ai, and other cloud-based meeting transcription tools, I got frustrated with:

🤖 Bots joining every single meeting
☁️ Audio uploaded to cloud servers
❌ No control over my meeting data
💰 Subscription-only pricing (no lifetime option)
📡 No offline capability

So I built EchoPanel - a Mac menu bar app that:

✅ Captures meeting audio locally (system audio capture, no bots)
✅ Runs entirely on your Mac using MLX backend
✅ Works completely offline - no internet required
✅ Never sends audio to cloud
✅ Offers lifetime pricing ($79 one-time vs. $10-20/mo subscriptions)

Technical Details:
- SwiftUI app with Python backend for ASR
- Local MLX backend for privacy (no cloud processing)
- Multi-source audio capture with redundancy (system + mic)
- Voice notes, context search (RAG), OCR screen capture
- Professional MOM templates (Engineering, Executive, Standard)
- Multiple export formats (JSON, Markdown, SRT, WebVTT)

Unique Features:
- Multi-source audio capture with automatic failover
- Voice notes integrated into meeting transcripts
- Context search to reference docs during meetings
- Engineering MOM templates designed for technical meetings

Would love feedback from HN community:
- Is local-only meeting intelligence valuable to you?
- What's your experience with cloud-based transcription?
- Which features would make this 10x better for you?

Try it free: [link]
GitHub: [link if public]

Built by solo developer in [location]. Happy to answer any technical questions!
```

### 2.3 Engagement Strategy

**Response Guidelines:**
- **Respond within 10 minutes** to every comment
- **Be helpful** - answer technical questions with code references
- **Be transparent** - acknowledge limitations honestly
- **Be grateful** - thank community for feedback

**Comment Categories to Prepare For:**

1. **Privacy Skepticism:**
   - "How do we know it's truly local-only?"
   - Response: "Great question. You can verify by monitoring network activity with Activity Monitor during a session. Zero network traffic to echoPanel domains. All processing happens via MLX (Metal-accelerated) on your machine. Source code available for audit."

2. **Accuracy Questions:**
   - "How does accuracy compare to Whisper?"
   - Response: "We support multiple ASR models including Whisper (large-v3, base) and MLX. In our testing, MLX Qwen3-ASR achieves 90%+ accuracy on clear audio, comparable to Whisper base with better performance on Apple Silicon. We're continuously improving."

3. **Open Source Requests:**
   - "Why isn't it open source?"
   - Response: "Valid question. As a solo developer building sustainable business, I'm keeping source closed for now to fund development. However, all architecture is documented, and I'm very transparent about how it works. Long-term, I may open source components."

4. **Feature Requests:**
   - "Can you add X feature?"
   - Response: "Great idea! I'm tracking all feature requests in our public roadmap: [link]. Prioritizing based on beta tester feedback. This is currently at [priority] level. Would you be interested in beta testing it?"

### 2.4 Hacker News Success Metrics

**Primary Metrics:**
- **Upvotes:** Target: 50+ (good visibility)
- **Comments:** Target: 30+ (shows engagement)
- **Front Page:** Target: Make front page (requires ~50-100 upvotes)

**Secondary Metrics:**
- **Website Traffic:** Referral traffic from HN
- **Email Signups:** Waitlist signups from HN
- **GitHub Stars:** If source is public

**Success Thresholds:**
- **Excellent:** Front page, 100+ upvotes, 50+ comments
- **Good:** Front page, 50+ upvotes, 30+ comments
- **Acceptable:** Not front page, 30+ upvotes, 15+ comments
- **Needs Improvement:** <20 upvotes, <10 comments

## 4. Social Media Strategy

### 4.1 Twitter/X Strategy

**Pre-Launch (7 Days Before):**

**Objectives:** Build following, create anticipation, establish expertise

**Daily Content (7 Days):**

**Day -7: Teaser**
- Tweet: "Building something for privacy-conscious Mac users who are tired of cloud meeting transcription tools. 🧵 Launching soon on Product Hunt. 

#MacApps #Privacy #Productivity"
- Goal: Test interest, build early following

**Day -6: Problem Highlight**
- Tweet thread (3 tweets):
  1. "Cloud transcription bots are everywhere. 🤖

Otter, Fireflies, tl;dv - they all join your calls, upload audio to cloud, store your data on their servers.

For technical meetings, client calls, or confidential discussions - this is unacceptable."
  2. "Privacy concerns aren't just about data breaches. 

It's about control. 

Who has access to your meeting transcripts?
Which country's laws apply to your data?
Can you delete everything if needed?

Cloud tools can't answer these questions clearly."
  3. "So I'm building EchoPanel. 🧵

Local-only meeting transcription for Mac.
No cloud uploads. No bots. Your data on your machine.

Coming soon."

**Day -5: Feature Teaser 1**
- Tweet: "Multi-source audio capture with redundancy. 

If one audio source fails, EchoPanel automatically switches.

Built for professionals who can't afford to miss details.

#MacApps #Productivity #Privacy"

**Day -4: Feature Teaser 2**
- Tweet: "Voice notes integrated into meeting transcripts. 

Quickly capture thoughts during breaks, then search them alongside your meeting notes.

No competitor offers this.

#MacApps #Productivity"

**Day -3: Privacy Deep-Dive**
- Tweet thread (5 tweets):
  1. "How EchoPanel keeps your meetings private: 

Thread 🧵"

**Day -2: Technical Preview**
- Tweet: "Quick architecture preview:

- Local MLX processing
- Multi-source audio capture
- Thread-safe operations

Built for reliability.

#MacDev #SwiftUI #Productivity"

**Day -1: Countdown**
- Tweet: "Launching in 24 hours on Product Hunt! 

Privacy-focused meeting transcription for Mac. Your data stays on your machine.

Set a reminder: [link to PH profile]

#ProductHunt #MacApps #Privacy"

**Launch Day Strategy:**

**12:01 AM PT:**
- Tweet: "🚀 Just launched EchoPanel on Product Hunt!

Privacy-focused meeting transcription for Mac. Your data stays on your machine.

Check it out: [link]

#ProductHunt #MacApps #Privacy #Productivity"

- 10% Engage with community

**Follower Growth Target:**
- Week 1: 100-200 followers
- Week 2: 200-400 followers
- Month 1: 500-1,000 followers

### 4.2 LinkedIn Strategy

**Posting Frequency:**
- 2-3 posts per week (Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday)

**Content Strategy:**

**Post Type 1: Professional/Founder Story**
```
As a founder, back-to-back meetings used to mean I had no idea what was decided or who owned what action item.

So I built EchoPanel.

Mac-native meeting transcription that:
- Works completely offline (local MLX backend)
- Captures system audio directly (no bots)
- Exports professional MOM templates
- Offers lifetime pricing ($79 one-time)

Built for founders who need clarity without the complexity of enterprise tools.

Link in comments 👇
```

**Post Type 2: Product/Engineering Focus**
```
Technical meetings need more than just transcription.

They need:
- Accurate capture of terminology and decisions
- Engineering-specific documentation formats
- Integration with existing tools (Jira, GitHub)
- Reliability for 6+ hour architecture reviews

EchoPanel was built for product and engineering teams with these exact needs.

Features designed for technical workflows:
✅ Engineering MOM templates
✅ JSON export for API integration
✅ Context search to reference docs during meetings
✅ Multi-source audio capture with redundancy

Built by a solo developer who cares about privacy and reliability.

Link in comments 👇
```

**Post Type 3: Thought Leadership**
```
The future of meeting intelligence isn't more AI features.

It's giving users control over their data.

Current state:
❌ Cloud-first architecture (data leaves your device)
❌ Bots in every meeting (disruptive)
❌ Subscription-only (no ownership)

Better approach:
✅ Local-first architecture (data stays on device)
✅ No bots required (unobtrusive)
✅ Lifetime options (ownership matters)

This is the future we're building with EchoPanel.

What do you think?
