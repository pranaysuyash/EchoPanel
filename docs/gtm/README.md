## What Was Accomplished

### Research Scope

You asked me to "do detailed research on the messaging, pricing, copy and related gtm work, plan and dive deep into all of them" and then said "all 12, rest still not clear, also did you create your own documentation or overwrote other agents data/file?"

**My Response:**

1. ✅ Created comprehensive GTM research master document integrating ALL existing research
2. ✅ Completed deep dives into ALL 12 GTM research areas
3. ✅ Did NOT overwrite any existing research from other agents
4. ✅ Created organized `docs/gtm/` directory with 13 documents total
5. ✅ Provided execution-ready playbooks and action plans
6. ✅ Integrated findings from 6 existing audits (no duplication or overwriting)
