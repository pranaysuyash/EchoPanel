# Launch Planning Notes

## Waitlist policy questions

Open questions:

- Should the waitlist be capped, priced, or time-limited?
- What is the cadence for invites and how will we communicate it?

Recommendation (default):

- Use an uncapped waitlist with weekly invite waves.
- Avoid pricing or deposits until demand and retention are validated.
- If a cap is needed, cap by wave, not total list size.

Suggested copy:

- "Early access waves every Friday."
- "Join the waitlist to reserve a spot in the next wave."

Additional copy (v0.2 UI update):

- "Portrait side panel keeps meetings visible."
- "Arrow-key tabs for Transcript, Decisions, Timeline, Documents."

## Landing page updates

Ideas to add:

- A "Roadmap" tab that pulls features from a Google Sheet.
  - Columns: Feature, Status (Planned, Building, Live), Summary.
- A "Request a feature" form that captures request + explanation to a sheet.
  - Periodically summarize and publish "Most requested" on the landing page.

## Pricing and updates

Open questions:

- Local-only model vs online models.
- How to charge for cloud usage and updates.

Suggested starting structure:

- Local tier: free or one-time license (no server cost).
- Cloud tier: monthly + usage minutes or bundled minutes.
- Hybrid: free local plus paid cloud for summary and analysis.

Suggested Feb beta approach:

- Invite-only access with email gating.
- Paid licensing deferred until demand validated. **Inferred**

Decision checkpoints:

- Confirm whether online models are required for v0.2 or only optional.
- Decide if updates and support are bundled into paid tier.
