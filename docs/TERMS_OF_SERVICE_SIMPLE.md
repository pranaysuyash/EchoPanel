# Terms of Service

**Effective:** February 16, 2026
**EchoPanel** by Solo Developer

## 🎯 **What EchoPanel Is**

EchoPanel is a macOS app that:
- Transcribes your meetings in real-time
- Extracts insights, action items, and decisions
- Helps you search and organize meeting content
- Works locally on your Mac (cloud features optional)

## ✅ **What You Can Do**

**Use EchoPanel to:**
- Record and transcribe your own meetings
- Capture voice notes and memos
- Analyze your meeting content
- Export transcripts for your use

**Things to keep in mind:**
- **Get consent:** Record meetings only with everyone's permission
- **Follow laws:** Comply with local recording laws
- **Respect privacy:** Don't record sensitive conversations without permission
- **Use responsibly:** This is a tool to help you, not for misuse

## ❌ **What You Can't Do**

**Please don't:**
- Record people without their consent
- Use the app for illegal stuff
- Try to reverse-engineer or copy the app
- Distribute or sell the app as your own

## 💰 **Payments (If Applicable)**

**If there's a paid version:**
- You can cancel anytime
- Refunds handled case-by-case (email me)
- Price changes get 30-day notice
- You can read the details before purchasing

## 🔒 **Your Data, Your Rights**

**You own your meeting content:**
- Transcripts are yours to use however you want
- You can export and delete anytime
- I don't claim any rights to your meeting data
- Export formats are designed to be portable

## ⚖️ **My Responsibilities (and limits)**

**I promise to:**
- Make the app work as described
- Fix bugs when I can
- Protect your privacy (see Privacy Policy)
- Be transparent about what the app does

**But I can't guarantee:**
- Perfect transcription accuracy (speech recognition isn't perfect)
- 100% uptime (stuff happens, internet goes out)
- Compatibility with every macOS configuration
- Business decisions based on app output (verify important stuff yourself)

## 🚫 **Limitation of Liability**

**In plain English:**
- I built this app to help you, but I'm not responsible if something goes wrong
- Use your meeting transcripts as one source of information, not the only source
- My liability is limited to what you paid for the app (if anything)
- I'm not responsible for business decisions made based on app output

## 📧 **Questions? Problems?**

**I'm a solo developer** and I actually respond:
- **Support:** support@echopanel.app
- **General:** echo@echopanel.app
- **Twitter:** @echopanel (if I have it set up)

I typically respond within 24-48 hours unless I'm on vacation or something major comes up.

## 🔄 **Updates**

**If I change these terms:**
- I'll let you know in the app
- I'll update the date at the top
- Continued use means you accept the changes
- You can always stop using and delete your data

## 📜 **Legal Stuff (Plain English)**

**Governing law:** These terms are governed by the laws where I live (I'll specify this based on where you're located)

**Disputes:** Let's try to work things out informally first. If that doesn't work, we can figure out the next steps.

**Severability:** If someone decides one part of these terms isn't enforceable, the rest still applies.

## 🎓 **Specific Uses**

**Workplace:** Follow your employer's policies on recording meetings

**Education:** If you're a student, follow your school's policies. Teachers/instructors: be aware of recording policies in your classroom.

**Professional Services:** If you're a lawyer, doctor, therapist, etc. - be extra careful about confidentiality. This app doesn't replace professional note-taking services.

## 👶 **Age**

**This app is for 13+ users.** If you're under 13, please don't use it.

## 📄 **Related Documents**

**Read these too:**
- **Privacy Policy:** Details about data and privacy
- **App Store Privacy:** Specific privacy information for Apple

## 🤝 **Thanks for Using EchoPanel**

**I built this because I needed it** and I hope it helps you too.

If you have questions, feedback, or just want to say hi - I'd love to hear from you.
