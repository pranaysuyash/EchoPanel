# UI-008 Lens Toggle on Focused Segment

## Summary

- Origin: Code-only
- Status: Hypothesized
- User toggles lens view on the currently focused transcript segment using Enter key.
- Boundaries crossed: UI
- Primary components (coarse list): SidePanelView, SidePanelStateLogic

## Triggers and Preconditions

- Triggers (user action, event, schedule, startup, etc.): User presses Enter key while side panel is focused
- Preconditions (permissions, settings flags, availability, model cached, etc.): Side panel is open, a segment is focused (focusedSegmentID != nil)

## Sequence (Happy Path)

Use numbered sequence. Each step must include evidence.
For each step:

1. <what happens>
   - Evidence:
     - Code: path :: symbol/event/string
     - Docs: path :: heading/snippet
   - Notes: (only if needed)

1. User presses Enter key
   - Evidence:
     - Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/SidePanel/Shared/SidePanelStateLogic.swift :: handleKeyEvent (case 36: return)
   - Notes: Key code 36 for return/enter

1. toggleLens called with focusedSegmentID
   - Evidence:
     - Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/SidePanel/Shared/SidePanelStateLogic.swift :: toggleLens(\_ id: UUID)
   - Notes: Only if focusedSegmentID exists

1. toggleLens sets lensSegmentID to the id if nil, or clears it if already set
   - Evidence:
     - Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/SidePanel/Shared/SidePanelStateLogic.swift :: toggleLens
   - Notes: lensSegmentID = lensSegmentID == id ? nil : id

1. UI shows/hides lens overlay for the segment
   - Evidence:
     - Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/SidePanel/Shared/SidePanelStateLogic.swift :: lensSegmentID @Published
   - Notes: Hypothesized - SwiftUI conditional rendering

## Inputs and Outputs

- Inputs: Enter key press
- Outputs: Lens overlay appears/disappears on focused segment
- Side effects (writes, network calls, model loads, UI state changes): UI state change for lensSegmentID

## Failure Modes

List 5–10 realistic failures:

- Failure: No focused segment
  - Where detected: handleKeyEvent
  - Current handling (as evidenced): Guard let id = focusedSegmentID
  - User-visible outcome (if any): No action
  - Evidence: Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/SidePanel/Shared/SidePanelStateLogic.swift :: if let id = focusedSegmentID

- Failure: Lens overlay fails to render
  - Where detected: SwiftUI rendering
  - Current handling (as evidenced): None evidenced
  - User-visible outcome (if any): Lens not shown/hidden
  - Evidence: Hypothesized

## Data and Storage

- What data is produced/consumed: lensSegmentID UUID (optional)
- Where it is stored (DB/files/userData/etc.): In-memory @State/@Published in SidePanelView
- Retention / deletion controls (if documented): None, resets on view recreation

## Observability

- Logs/events emitted: None evidenced
- Correlation IDs / session IDs (if any): None
- Metrics/traces (if any): None evidenced

## Open Questions and Follow-up Tasks

- Questions that cannot be answered from current evidence: What does the lens overlay show?
- Documentation gaps to fill: Lens UI implementation and content
- Test gaps to add (note only, no implementation): Test lens toggle opens/closes correctly</content>
