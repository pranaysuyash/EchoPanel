# UI-004 Search and Navigation

## Summary

- Origin: Code-only
- Status: Hypothesized
- Search and navigation within transcript and insights.
- Boundaries crossed: UI
- Primary components (coarse list): SidePanelView, AppState

## Triggers and Preconditions

- Triggers (user action, event, schedule, startup, etc.): User types in search field
- Preconditions (permissions, settings flags, availability, model cached, etc.): Full mode active

## Sequence (Happy Path)

Use numbered sequence. Each step must include evidence.
For each step:

1. <what happens>
   - Evidence:
     - Code: path :: symbol/event/string
     - Docs: path :: heading/snippet
   - Notes: (only if needed)

1. User enters search query
   - Evidence:
     - Docs: docs/UI.md :: Search field
   - Notes: Hypothesized - search input

1. Filter and highlight results
   - Evidence:
     - Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/EntityHighlighter.swift
   - Notes: Hypothesized - filtering logic

## Inputs and Outputs

- Inputs: Search query
- Outputs: Filtered results
- Side effects (writes, network calls, model loads, UI state changes): UI highlighting

## Failure Modes

- Failure: Search fails
  - Where detected: Search components
  - Current handling (as evidenced): None evidenced
  - User-visible outcome (if any): No results
  - Evidence: Hypothesized

## Data and Storage

- What data is produced/consumed: Search query, transcript data
- Where it is stored (DB/files/userData/etc.): AppState
- Retention / deletion controls (if documented): None

## Observability

- Logs/events emitted: None
- Correlation IDs / session IDs (if any): None
- Metrics/traces (if any): None
  Evidence: None evidenced

## Open Questions and Follow-up Tasks

- Questions that cannot be answered from current evidence: What search algorithms? How are results highlighted?
- Documentation gaps to fill: Search functionality design
- Test gaps to add (note only, no implementation): Search queries, result highlighting</content>
