# UI-005 Export UI Actions

## Summary

- Origin: Code-only
- Status: Hypothesized
- User-initiated export actions for JSON, Markdown, and debug bundles.
- Boundaries crossed: UI / Storage
- Primary components (coarse list): SidePanelView, AppState

## Triggers and Preconditions

- Triggers (user action, event, schedule, startup, etc.): User clicks export buttons
- Preconditions (permissions, settings flags, availability, model cached, etc.): Session data available

## Sequence (Happy Path)

Use numbered sequence. Each step must include evidence.
For each step:

1. <what happens>
   - Evidence:
     - Code: path :: symbol/event/string
     - Docs: path :: heading/snippet
   - Notes: (only if needed)

1. User clicks export button
   - Evidence:
     - Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/SidePanelTranscriptSurfaces.swift :: Button("Export JSON")
   - Notes: Hypothesized - export buttons

1. Trigger export flow
   - Evidence:
     - Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/AppState.swift :: exportJSON()
   - Notes: Hypothesized - export methods

## Inputs and Outputs

- Inputs: Export type selection
- Outputs: File save dialogs
- Side effects (writes, network calls, model loads, UI state changes): File writes

## Failure Modes

- Failure: Export fails
  - Where detected: Export methods
  - Current handling (as evidenced): None evidenced
  - User-visible outcome (if any): Error messages
  - Evidence: Hypothesized

## Data and Storage

- What data is produced/consumed: Session data
- Where it is stored (DB/files/userData/etc.): User-selected files
- Retention / deletion controls (if documented): User-managed

## Observability

- Logs/events emitted: None
- Correlation IDs / session IDs (if any): None
- Metrics/traces (if any): None
  Evidence: None evidenced

## Open Questions and Follow-up Tasks

- Questions that cannot be answered from current evidence: What export formats? How are errors handled?
- Documentation gaps to fill: Export UI design
- Test gaps to add (note only, no implementation): Export button clicks, error handling</content>
