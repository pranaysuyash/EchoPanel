# UI-001 Menu Bar Interaction

## Summary

- Origin: Code-only
- Status: Hypothesized
- User interaction with macOS menu bar icon for quick access to app controls and status.
- Boundaries crossed: UI / OS
- Primary components (coarse list): MenuBarExtra, MeetingListenerApp

## Triggers and Preconditions

- Triggers (user action, event, schedule, startup, etc.): User clicks menu bar icon
- Preconditions (permissions, settings flags, availability, model cached, etc.): App running

## Sequence (Happy Path)

Use numbered sequence. Each step must include evidence.
For each step:

1. <what happens>
   - Evidence:
     - Code: path :: symbol/event/string
     - Docs: path :: heading/snippet
   - Notes: (only if needed)

1. User clicks menu bar icon
   - Evidence:
     - Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/MeetingListenerApp.swift :: MenuBarExtra
   - Notes: Hypothesized - menu bar interaction

1. Menu displays status and controls
   - Evidence:
     - Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/MeetingListenerApp.swift :: menuContent
   - Notes: Hypothesized - menu content display

## Inputs and Outputs

- Inputs: User click
- Outputs: Menu display
- Side effects (writes, network calls, model loads, UI state changes): Menu UI shown

## Failure Modes

- Failure: Menu fails to display
  - Where detected: MenuBarExtra
  - Current handling (as evidenced): None evidenced
  - User-visible outcome (if any): Menu not shown
  - Evidence: Hypothesized

## Data and Storage

- What data is produced/consumed: None
- Where it is stored (DB/files/userData/etc.): None
- Retention / deletion controls (if documented): None

## Observability

- Logs/events emitted: None
- Correlation IDs / session IDs (if any): None
- Metrics/traces (if any): None
  Evidence: None evidenced

## Open Questions and Follow-up Tasks

- Questions that cannot be answered from current evidence: What menu items are available? How does it integrate with app state?
- Documentation gaps to fill: Menu bar interaction design
- Test gaps to add (note only, no implementation): Menu bar click, menu item selection</content>
