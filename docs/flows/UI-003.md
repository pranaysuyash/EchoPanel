# UI-003 Transcript Rendering

## Summary

- Origin: Code-only
- Status: Hypothesized
- Rendering of live transcript with timestamps, speakers, and formatting.
- Boundaries crossed: UI
- Primary components (coarse list): SidePanelView, AppState

## Triggers and Preconditions

- Triggers (user action, event, schedule, startup, etc.): New transcript segments received
- Preconditions (permissions, settings flags, availability, model cached, etc.): Session active

## Sequence (Happy Path)

Use numbered sequence. Each step must include evidence.
For each step:

1. <what happens>
   - Evidence:
     - Code: path :: symbol/event/string
     - Docs: path :: heading/snippet
   - Notes: (only if needed)

1. Receive transcript update
   - Evidence:
     - Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/AppState.swift :: transcriptSegments
   - Notes: Hypothesized - transcript data

1. Render transcript in UI
   - Evidence:
     - Docs: docs/UI.md :: Transcript rendering rules
   - Notes: Hypothesized - rendering logic

## Inputs and Outputs

- Inputs: Transcript segments
- Outputs: UI display
- Side effects (writes, network calls, model loads, UI state changes): UI updates

## Failure Modes

- Failure: Rendering fails
  - Where detected: UI components
  - Current handling (as evidenced): None evidenced
  - User-visible outcome (if any): Display issues
  - Evidence: Hypothesized

## Data and Storage

- What data is produced/consumed: Transcript segments
- Where it is stored (DB/files/userData/etc.): AppState
- Retention / deletion controls (if documented): Session-based

## Observability

- Logs/events emitted: None
- Correlation IDs / session IDs (if any): None
- Metrics/traces (if any): None
  Evidence: None evidenced

## Open Questions and Follow-up Tasks

- Questions that cannot be answered from current evidence: How are speakers identified? What formatting rules?
- Documentation gaps to fill: Transcript display logic
- Test gaps to add (note only, no implementation): Rendering with speakers, timestamp display</content>
