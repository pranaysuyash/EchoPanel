# UI-002 Side Panel Display

## Summary

- Origin: Code-only
- Status: Hypothesized
- Display of floating side panel with transcript, controls, and insights.
- Boundaries crossed: UI
- Primary components (coarse list): SidePanelView, SidePanelController

## Triggers and Preconditions

- Triggers (user action, event, schedule, startup, etc.): Menu bar action or hotkey
- Preconditions (permissions, settings flags, availability, model cached, etc.): App running

## Sequence (Happy Path)

Use numbered sequence. Each step must include evidence.
For each step:

1. <what happens>
   - Evidence:
     - Code: path :: symbol/event/string
     - Docs: path :: heading/snippet
   - Notes: (only if needed)

1. Trigger side panel display
   - Evidence:
     - Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/SidePanel/SidePanelView.swift
   - Notes: Hypothesized - side panel view

1. Panel shows transcript and controls
   - Evidence:
     - Docs: docs/UI.md :: Floating side panel
   - Notes: Hypothesized - panel content

## Inputs and Outputs

- Inputs: Display trigger
- Outputs: Panel UI
- Side effects (writes, network calls, model loads, UI state changes): UI window shown

## Failure Modes

- Failure: Panel fails to display
  - Where detected: SidePanelController
  - Current handling (as evidenced): None evidenced
  - User-visible outcome (if any): Panel not shown
  - Evidence: Hypothesized

## Data and Storage

- What data is produced/consumed: None
- Where it is stored (DB/files/userData/etc.): None
- Retention / deletion controls (if documented): None

## Observability

- Logs/events emitted: None
- Correlation IDs / session IDs (if any): None
- Metrics/traces (if any): None
  Evidence: None evidenced

## Open Questions and Follow-up Tasks

- Questions that cannot be answered from current evidence: How is panel triggered? What modes does it have?
- Documentation gaps to fill: Side panel interaction design
- Test gaps to add (note only, no implementation): Panel display, mode switching</content>
