# SEC-002 Microphone Permission Flow

## Summary

- Origin: Code-only
- Status: Implemented
- App requests macOS Microphone permission required for microphone audio capture, handling AVFoundation TCC integration.
- Boundaries crossed: OS (macOS TCC permissions)
- Primary components (coarse list): MicrophoneCaptureManager, AVCaptureDevice

## Triggers and Preconditions

- Triggers (user action, event, schedule, startup, etc.): Session start requiring microphone audio
- Preconditions (permissions, settings flags, availability, model cached, etc.): AVFoundation available, permission not already granted

## Sequence (Happy Path)

Use numbered sequence. Each step must include evidence.
For each step:

1. <what happens>
   - Evidence:
     - Code: path :: symbol/event/string
     - Docs: path :: heading/snippet
   - Notes: (only if needed)

1. Check current permission status
   - Evidence:
     - Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/MicrophoneCaptureManager.swift :: AVCaptureDevice.authorizationStatus(.audio)
   - Notes: Check before requesting

1. If not authorized, request permission via AVFoundation
   - Evidence:
     - Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/MicrophoneCaptureManager.swift :: AVCaptureDevice.requestAccess(for: .audio)
   - Notes: Shows system permission dialog

1. User grants permission in system dialog
   - Evidence:
     - Code: AVFoundation framework (no code)
   - Notes: User interaction required

1. Update app state with permission result
   - Evidence:
     - Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/AppState.swift :: microphonePermission = .authorized
   - Notes: Enables microphone capture

## Inputs and Outputs

- Inputs:
  - User intent to capture microphone audio
  - Current TCC permission state
- Outputs:
  - Updated permission state in app
  - System permission grant (persistent)
- Side effects (writes, network calls, model loads, UI state changes): TCC database updated, permission persisted

## Failure Modes

List 5–10 realistic failures:

- Failure: Permission request fails
  - Where detected: requestAccess completion false
  - Current handling (as evidenced): Set permission to .denied
  - User-visible outcome (if any): Error message shown
  - Evidence: Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/AppState.swift :: microphonePermission = .denied

- Failure: User denies permission
  - Where detected: Permission not granted
  - Current handling (as evidenced): Block microphone capture
  - User-visible outcome (if any): "Microphone permission required" error
  - Evidence: Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/AppState.swift :: setSessionError(.microphonePermissionRequired)

- Failure: AVFoundation unavailable
  - Where detected: AVCaptureDevice not available
  - Current handling (as evidenced): Fallback to system audio only
  - User-visible outcome (if any): Microphone audio disabled
  - Evidence: Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/MicrophoneCaptureManager.swift :: guard let device

- Failure: Permission revoked during session
  - Where detected: Authorization status changes
  - Current handling (as evidenced): No monitoring, session continues
  - User-visible outcome (if any): Silent failure
  - Evidence: Code: No observer for permission changes

- Failure: Multiple apps requesting simultaneously
  - Where detected: System dialog conflicts
  - Current handling (as evidenced): Standard AVFoundation behavior
  - User-visible outcome (if any): Dialog shown, user chooses
  - Evidence: Code: AVFoundation handles conflicts

## Data and Storage

- What data is produced/consumed: Permission grant state
- Where it is stored (DB/files/userData/etc.): macOS TCC database
- Retention / deletion controls (if documented): Persistent until revoked in System Settings

## Observability

- Logs/events emitted: Permission state changes logged
- Correlation IDs / session IDs (if any): None
- Metrics/traces (if any): None
- Evidence: Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/AppState.swift :: StructuredLogger in startSession

## Open Questions and Follow-up Tasks

- Questions that cannot be answered from current evidence: None
- Documentation gaps to fill: None
- Test gaps to add (note only, no implementation): Test permission revocation during session
