# UI-010 Follow Live Toggle

## Summary

- Origin: Code-only
- Status: Hypothesized
- User toggles follow-live mode using Space key, controlling whether transcript auto-scrolls to latest segments.
- Boundaries crossed: UI
- Primary components (coarse list): SidePanelView, SidePanelStateLogic

## Triggers and Preconditions

- Triggers (user action, event, schedule, startup, etc.): User presses Space key while side panel is focused
- Preconditions (permissions, settings flags, availability, model cached, etc.): Side panel is open

## Sequence (Happy Path)

Use numbered sequence. Each step must include evidence.
For each step:

1. <what happens>
   - Evidence:
     - Code: path :: symbol/event/string
     - Docs: path :: heading/snippet
   - Notes: (only if needed)

1. User presses Space key
   - Evidence:
     - Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/SidePanel/Shared/SidePanelStateLogic.swift :: handleKeyEvent (case 49: space)
   - Notes: Key code 49 for space

1. followLive toggled
   - Evidence:
     - Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/SidePanel/Shared/SidePanelStateLogic.swift :: followLive.toggle()
   - Notes: Boolean toggle

1. If followLive now true, scroll to bottom triggered
   - Evidence:
     - Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/SidePanel/Shared/SidePanelStateLogic.swift :: followLive @Published, triggers scrollToBottomToken
   - Notes: Hypothesized - reactive scroll behavior

1. UI updates follow-live indicator and scroll position
   - Evidence:
     - Code: macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Sources/SidePanel/Shared/SidePanelStateLogic.swift :: followLive @Published
   - Notes: Hypothesized - SwiftUI reactive update

## Inputs and Outputs

- Inputs: Space key press
- Outputs: Follow-live mode toggles, auto-scroll enabled/disabled, UI indicator changes
- Side effects (writes, network calls, model loads, UI state changes): UI state change for followLive, possible scroll to bottom

## Failure Modes

List 5–10 realistic failures:

- Failure: Toggle fails to update UI
  - Where detected: SwiftUI rendering
  - Current handling (as evidenced): None evidenced
  - User-visible outcome (if any): Indicator not updated
  - Evidence: Hypothesized

- Failure: Scroll to bottom fails
  - Where detected: SwiftUI ScrollView
  - Current handling (as evidenced): None evidenced
  - User-visible outcome (if any): Transcript doesn't scroll
  - Evidence: Hypothesized

## Data and Storage

- What data is produced/consumed: followLive Bool
- Where it is stored (DB/files/userData/etc.): In-memory @State/@Published in SidePanelView
- Retention / deletion controls (if documented): None, resets on view recreation

## Observability

- Logs/events emitted: None evidenced
- Correlation IDs / session IDs (if any): None
- Metrics/traces (if any): None evidenced

## Open Questions and Follow-up Tasks

- Questions that cannot be answered from current evidence: How is follow-live visually indicated?
- Documentation gaps to fill: Follow-live UI indicator implementation
- Test gaps to add (note only, no implementation): Test space toggles follow-live state</content>
