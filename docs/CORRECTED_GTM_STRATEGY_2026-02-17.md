## Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plans

### **Major Risks & Mitigation**

**Risk 1: Market confusion about positioning**
- **Mitigation:** Clear messaging emphasizing "audio intelligence platform, not just transcription"
- **Signal:** Users expecting basic transcription, not understanding advanced features
- **Contingency:** Create onboarding flow highlighting advanced features, improve messaging

**Risk 2: Technical complexity overwhelms casual users**
- **Mitigation:** Progressive disclosure of features, excellent onboarding
- **Signal:** High churn rate within first week, poor activation of advanced features
- **Contingency:** Simplify onboarding, create "basic mode" vs "advanced mode"

**Risk 3: Solo developer scalability challenges**
- **Mitigation:** Automated support, community management, feature prioritization
- **Signal:** Unable to provide 24-hour support, bug backlog grows
- **Contingency:** Hire part-time support, limit new user acquisition, focus on stability

**Risk 4: Competitive response from major players**
- **Mitigation:** Focus on unique differentiators (session recovery, debug bundles, voice notes)
- **Signal:** Otter/Fireflies add session management or local processing
- **Contingency:** Double down on technical sophistication, add enterprise features

**Risk 5: App Store rejection or poor positioning**
- **Mitigation:** Careful adherence to guidelines, professional screenshots
- **Signal:** Rejection during review, poor discoverability in App Store
- **Contingency:** Direct download distribution, web emphasis, alternative marketing

### **Decision Triggers**

**Continue Scaling If:**
- 15%+ free-to-paid conversion (validates value proposition)
- 4.5+ App Store rating (validates user satisfaction)
- 30%+ of users from referrals (validates product-market fit)
- $75K+ ARR within 12 months (validates business model)

**Pivot to Niche/Specialized If:**
- <10% free-to-paid conversion after 6 months
- Unable to secure $50K+ ARR within 12 months
- User feedback indicates need for specialization
- Competitive pressure in general market

**Adjust Strategy If:**
- Lifetime sales <50% of expected → emphasize subscription benefits
- Team features requested by >40% users → accelerate team tier development
- App Store drives <15% downloads → increase direct distribution efforts
- Advanced features have <20% adoption → improve discoverability and onboarding
