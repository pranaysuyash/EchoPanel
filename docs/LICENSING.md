# Licensing & Access (v0.2)

## Goals

- Keep beta onboarding simple and fast.
- Avoid building complex licensing enforcement before product-market fit.

## Recommended approach (Feb launch)

- **Private beta**: invite-only access with email gating.
- **Paid access (optional)**: use Gumroad for license key generation + email fulfillment.

## Enforcement (v0.2)

- **Lightweight**: do not block core functionality with hard checks.
- **Soft gating**: show “License status: Beta” in Settings and allow manual key entry later.

## Data handling

- Store license receipt locally in app preferences.
- Do not transmit license keys to any server by default.

## Open questions

- Pricing strategy (per-seat vs per-device).
- Whether to add usage-based metering for longer sessions.
