# QA Test Plan — Three-Cut Side Panel + Launch Readiness (2026-02-06)

**Scope**: TCK-20260206-004/005/006/007/008/014/015/016

**Surfaces impacted**: macapp | landing | docs

**Key risks**: permissions, capture regressions, keyboard navigation, follow-live state drift, full-view parity drift, landing copy mismatch

**Repo access**: YES

## Update (2026-02-13)

This test plan is a point-in-time artifact for the 2026-02-06 launch UI cut. As of 2026-02-13, several items in the "Missing automated tests" section are no longer true:

- Visual snapshot tests exist for SidePanel layouts and streaming states but are opt-in (environment-sensitive). Evidence: `macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Tests/SidePanelVisualSnapshotTests.swift` (RUN_VISUAL_SNAPSHOTS gating), `macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Tests/StreamingVisualTests.swift` (RUN_VISUAL_SNAPSHOTS gating).
- A larger unit-test suite exists for streaming reliability/hardening, auth gating, audio limiter/clipping, and contracts (not only build-only validation). Evidence: `macapp/MeetingListenerApp/Tests/` (multiple XCTest targets), `tests/` (pytest suite).

The manual checks below are still relevant, but reconnect behavior and start/listening truthfulness now have stronger guardrails (start timeout + bounded reconnects) and should be validated explicitly.

## A) Test matrix

- Platforms: macOS 13, macOS 14 (Observed requirement); macOS 15 (Unknown)
- Audio sources: System / Mic / Both (Observed support in v0.2 status)
- Network: backend up / backend down / reconnecting

## B) Automated checks

- `cd macapp/MeetingListenerApp && swift build`
  - Expected: “Build complete!”
- `cd macapp/MeetingListenerApp && swift test`
  - Expected: tests pass
- `cd macapp/MeetingListenerApp && RUN_VISUAL_SNAPSHOTS=1 swift test`
  - Expected: snapshot tests run (environment-sensitive); use only when validating layout regressions
- `node -c landing/app.js`
  - Expected: no output, exit code 0
- `python -m pytest -q` (server)
  - Expected: tests pass (optional for UI change, but run before release)

**Still-missing automated tests to add** (Inferred):

- Keyboard navigation / focus-order tests (macapp). Snapshot tests catch visuals but not focus or key routing correctness.

## C) Manual tests (mandatory for capture workflows)

1. **First run onboarding**
   - Permission request + recovery path works.
2. **Start listening**
   - Panel opens in portrait layout.
   - Transcript appears within 2–5 seconds.
3. **Arrow-key navigation**
   - ←/→ rotates tabs (Transcript → Decisions → Timeline).
4. **Auto-scroll pause**
   - Scroll up; live feed pauses and “Resume Live” appears.
5. **Stop flow**
   - Summary opens; Copy Markdown and Export JSON still work.
6. **Backend disconnect**
   - Status shows reconnecting; recovery within 10 seconds.

## E) Three-cut parity checks (mandatory for native Swift handoff)

1. Start Listening and verify default mode is `Roll`.
2. Switch `Roll -> Compact -> Full`; verify panel dimensions and content hierarchy remain stable.
3. In `Full`, verify:
   - Session rail is rendered and selectable.
   - Work mode selector (`Live`, `Review`, `Brief`) updates visual state.
   - Search field accepts focus from `Cmd/Ctrl + K`.
   - Insight tabs include `Summary`, `Actions`, `Pins`, `Context`, `Entities`, `Raw`.
   - Timeline scrub moves focused transcript line.
4. In `Roll` and `Compact`, verify `←/→` opens/cycles surface overlay without affecting transcript focus movement.
5. With Reduce Motion enabled, verify follow-live jumps and focus changes remain usable without animated jitter.

## D) Pass/Fail criteria (evidence required)

- [ ] Portrait panel renders without overlapping meeting content (screenshot).
- [ ] Transcript rolls with last 12–20 segments (screen recording).
- [ ] Arrow-key tab switching works (screen recording).
- [ ] Start/Stop flow unchanged (screenshot of summary + exports).
- [ ] Landing page hero matches portrait UI (screenshot).
