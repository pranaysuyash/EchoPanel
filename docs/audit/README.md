## Archived Audits (42 files → `archive/`)

Point-in-time audits whose findings are resolved or superseded. Each has an obsolete header with **code evidence** proving resolution.

## Relocated (Not Audits)

These were previously in `docs/audit/` but are **not audits** — they're living reference docs:

| New Location | Files | Why |
|-------------|-------|-----|
| `docs/vision/` | Architecture vision, Companion vision, UI design concept | Future planning — still relevant |
| `docs/strategy/` | Commercialization strategy, User personas, Priorities | Business reference — still relevant |
| `docs/templates/` | Audit agent prompt, Refactor checklist | Reusable templates |
