# Audits

Store audit artifacts here (one audit = one file). Prefer naming:

`docs/audit/<surface>-<area>-<YYYYMMDD>.md`

Examples:
- `docs/audit/macapp-onboarding-20260204.md`
- `docs/audit/server-ws_live_listener-20260204.md`

Each audit should include:
- Scope contract
- Findings (prioritized)
- Evidence log (commands + outputs summarized)
- Remediation plan or linked tickets
