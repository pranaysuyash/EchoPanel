I built EchoPanel as a solo developer with privacy as the foundation. Here's exactly what happens with your data:

## 📊 **What Data I Collect**

### **Audio & Transcripts**

### **That's It**

## **Short Version**

**I built this to be privacy-focused:**
- ✅ Everything stored locally on your Mac by default
- ✅ You control how long data is kept
- ✅ You can delete everything anytime
- ✅ No selling, sharing, or ads
- ✅ Cloud features are optional (clearly labeled)

**Your data, your control.** That's the whole point.
