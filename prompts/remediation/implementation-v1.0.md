# Remediation Prompt (EchoPanel) — v1.0

**Goal**: This is a legacy remediation prompt. Prefer `prompts/remediation/implementation-v1.1.md`.

If you must use v1.0:
- restate the ticket’s scope contract before making changes
- keep changes tied to acceptance criteria
- run the smallest relevant verification commands
- update `docs/WORKLOG_TICKETS.md` with evidence + status
