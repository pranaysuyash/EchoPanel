# Worklog Prompt — v1.0

**Goal**: This is a legacy worklog prompt. Prefer `prompts/workflow/worklog-v1.1.md` for the full template + evidence log format.

If you must use v1.0:
- tickets are append-only in `docs/WORKLOG_TICKETS.md`
- include a scope contract and testable acceptance criteria
- include an evidence log with raw command outputs (or mark Unknown)
